# SIXTH DAY (14-Sept-2025):

```
Learned:
Learning DSA Python
```

Today I'm learning DSA Python, the projects I made are not very hard, and the problems I had, are very easy to solve. So I dont think is very good to add all the problems like before, the diary after today is only what I'm learning, what I struggle in the learning process. Have a Good Day!
