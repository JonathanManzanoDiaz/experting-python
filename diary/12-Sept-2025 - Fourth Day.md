# FOURTH DAY (12-Sept-2025):

## Fourth Project (UNITS CONVERSOR)

[VIEW PROJECT](https://github.com/JonathanManzanoDiaz/experting-python/tree/52a9f1991bd58cf5a3a4d73f9f191223e2fcd436/0004-units-conversor)

```
Learned:
argparse
```

Argparse is difficult for me because is the first time I used it, so for the rest is very easy
I only have problems with the use of argparse, the rest of the project is not a problem

First problem and last: Understand add_argument and parser args
